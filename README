You might be wondering why another Twitter gem/plugin...let me highlight why you should give mine a whirl.

1.) This Twitter plugin doesn't require any libraries with C bindings. This is good news for those you who
are constrained to JRuby.

2.) This Twitter plugin doesn't force you to use additional plugins or gems. 
My viewpoint is I want Twitter without 2, 3, or N number of additional gems or plugins in my application
just to use this one IF I don't have to.

3.) This Twitter plugin has some nice hooks for ActiveRecord models or just plain
classes that enable "tweets" based on callbacks.

4.) I am making an on going effort to add more "bot" like functionality to enable natural language
processing.

I'd like to thank Susan Potter author of the twitter4r gem and John Nunemaker author of the twitter gem
since I took inspiration from their efforts for various parts of my plugin.
